# GitHub README picture generation infrastructure

The animated SVGs you see [on my profile](https://github.com/dtinth) are
generated from code in this branch. They are server-rendered
([powered by Vercel](https://vercel.com/docs/runtimes#official-runtimes/node-js)),
which means itâ€™s possible to render dynamic content here.

## Development

```sh
yarn
yarn vercel dev
```
